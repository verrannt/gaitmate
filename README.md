### Easily record smartphone sensor data

A flutter app that records user's motion activity via smartphone sensor data and stores it locally when the recording is finished. The activity type can be specified when starting the recording and will be used in the naming of the stored recording, along with current date-time. It thus allows easy creation of time-series data of motion activity that can be used to train machine learning models to recognize motion activity from sensor data.
