# GaitMate

A flutter app that records user's motion activity upon request by the user and stores it locally when the recording is finished. The user can specify an activity name for the recorded activity so that the data can be used to train machine learning models to recognize human activities from smartphone sensor data.

This project is in early stage active development.
